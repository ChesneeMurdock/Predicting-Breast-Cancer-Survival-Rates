# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Survival-Rates
In this Breast Cancer dataset, I want to predict whether a tumor is a malignant diagnosis in order to provide insights into survival chances. I will use decision tree classifiers, random forest classifiers, and logisitic regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign in order to predict breast cancer survival rates.
