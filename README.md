# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Survival-Rates
In this Breast Cancer dataset, I want to predict whether a tumor is a malignant diagnosis in order to provide insights into survival chances. I will use decision tree classifiers, random forest classifiers, and logisitic regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign in order to predict breast cancer survival rates.

# **Supervised Learning (Binary Classification)**

This project is a category of **machine learning** that uses lagbeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns. It includes input (X-Features), output (y-Target), training the model, testing the model, and evaluating the performance of the model. Taking the data from this dataset, I am classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant based on numerical features. The results from this project can assist in making better clinical decisions and imporving diagnostic accuracy.

The models that I use in this project will learn from past tumor data. Once trained, the models can take new, unseen tumor measurements and predict whether the tumor is likely to be benigh or malignant.

This is beneficial to doctors by:

1. helping them make better decisions by providing an additional tool for diagnosis, 

2. asssiting in early detection of breast cancer, and 

3. reducing human error by leveraging statistical patterns in medical data.
